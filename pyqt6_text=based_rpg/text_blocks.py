introduction == ("You walk into the dark room, the soft sounds of the .outside world fading behind you as you enter and the door shuts loudly behind you sending a tremor throughout the room. You notice that there are numerous exits too the room and objects in the room

 In the far left corner theres a doorway, coated in moss and vines, gently swaying in a unfelt but heard wind

 In the far right corner theres a table pressed against the corner, a weird circular white and blue object shines and moves on its own, barely floating above the table, thrumming in a minor chord over and over again with each slow rotation.

 In the right corner front he entrance you just walked through theres a stairway leading downward into darkness, soft whispers come from the dark.

 In the left corner from the enterene there is a spiral staircase leading upwards towards light, water can be heard through the hole in the ceiling it would lead you through, the stairs themselves slick with condensation

 In the center of the room is a slightly raised platform with a pedestal on it, on the pedestal is a large dusty book
